This folder contains the scripts you will need to convert .tiff photos to the more versatile format of .png. 

There are two scripts, one labeled "Lower_Resolution_tiff2png.bat" and one labeled "Original_Resolution_tiff2png.bat".
The lower resolution script will save the photos in the standard 1920x1080 format which will allow for easier use and sharing.
The original resolution script will save the photos in their original resoltion which will keep the original image quality but 
will make them harder to use.
Both scripts save the processed photos in the much more versatile and usable format of .png. 

Follow the steps below for an idea of how to use these scripts.

=========================================

Steps:
1) Install Image Magick (Skip this step if you have previously installed it)
	- Run the File Labeled "ImageMagick-7.0.8-16-Q16-x64-dll.exe" that is included with this software
	- Follow the Image Magick Wizard for setup
2) Copy and Paste the file named "Lower_Resolution_tiff2png.bat" into whatever folder contains the .tiff images 
you want to process.
	- Double Click to run this file. It will open a command prompt window that will stay open until it is finished running.
	- The processed photos will be saved in a sub-folder labeled "Lower_Resolution"
3) Copy and Paste the file named "Original_Resolution_tiff2png.bat" into whatever folder contains the .tiff images 
you want to process.
	- Double Click to run this file. It will open a command prompt window that will stay open until it is finished running.
	- The processed photos will be saved in a sub-folder labeled "Original_Resolution"
4) The processed has finished. Repeat steps 2 & 3 for any other folders containing .tiff files that you want to process.
